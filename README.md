# Interview Practice Problems
This repo is the graveyard of interview practice problems I am working through.
Whenever I find I coding kata that seems interesting, my attempt ends up here.

At this point, most of the kata function (accomplish their goals), but are not very optimized.
My goal is to increase my speed and process.

Due to the nature of these kata, I will mostly be using TDD.
Most kata have verified expected results, allowing tests to be relatively simple to write.
